This is done by learning the underlying patterns and structures of the data and using them to generate new instances that are similar but not identical to the training data. Generative AI models can be used for a variety of applications, such as creating personalized content, generating synthetic data for training other AI models, and creating art or music. Examples of generative AI models include deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), and variational autoencoders (VAEs).'"
